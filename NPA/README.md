The Python program requires:
- [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy): a package for scientific computing with Python.
- [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy): a Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems.

Scripts of the Python program:
- **main.py**: computes an upper bound on the maximal social welfare with an NPA hierarchy verifying Nash equilibrium constraints.
