Code for the paper "Improving social welfare in non-cooperative games with different types of quantum resources" by Alastair A. Abbott, Mehdi Mhalla, and Pierre Pocreau, arXiv:2211.01687

The project is separated into two parts: 
- in the NPA folder, a Python program to compute an upper bound on the maximum quantum social welfare of a given game through a NPA hierarchy verifying some Nash equilibrium constraints.
- in the QSeeSaw folder, a Matlab program computing lower bounds on the quantum social welfare by using see-saw iterations as well as quantum and Nash equilibrium constraints. 
  

The QSeeSaw folder also contains the data and plots that can be found in the paper.
